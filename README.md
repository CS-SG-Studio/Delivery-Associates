## Project Overview
Over the last year, the coronavirus has impacted the lives of billions of people around the world. But in the last few months, vaccine development for this virus has advanced rapidly with a number of approved vaccines and more in development. Many experts identify that success in this vaccination distribution and adoption process is critical in ending this pandemic and ensuring the health and safety of people across the world. To address this problem, we will **develop a Global Vaccine Dashboard with COVID and demographic data highlighting (in)equity in testing and vaccine rollout.**
